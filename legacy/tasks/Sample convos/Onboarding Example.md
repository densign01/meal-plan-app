# Onboarding Example


AI: Hi! I'm here to help you set up your meal planning profile quickly.  I'll ask you just 4 key questions to get started - this should take less than 2 minutes.  First question: Tell me about your household - how many people, their names, ages for any children (we only need ages for kids), and any dietary restrictions?

* 3 people. Daniel (me), Abby (my wife), Lainie (15-month old daughter). No dietary restrictions

AI: Hello there! I'm so glad you're here. Let's get started with a few questions to get to know you better.  First off, what's your name?

* I just told you

AI: Oh, my apologies, Daniel! Thank you for your patience.   Now, tell me about your household. Is there anyone else living with you? Are any of them kids (and how old), and does anyone have dietary restrictions?

* Didn't I tell you?

AI: I’m sorry for the oversight, Daniel! You mentioned that you have Abby, your wife, and Lainie, your 15-month-old daughter. Thank you for that information!  Next, let’s talk about your cooking situation. What's your skill level (beginner, intermediate, or advanced), and how much time do you usually have for cooking meals?

* Intermediate -- I have around 30-45 minutes but have a pretty stocked ktichen

AI: Great! It sounds like you have a solid setup for cooking.  Finally, what foods do you love and what do you avoid? Do you have any favorite cuisines or specific dislikes?

* I love pasta and hate fish
